# DATA_SOURCES.md

Every external source Voltpath relies on. The rule: **real, citable data is the default; synthetic data is the rare, explicitly-labeled exception.** Every number used in the product traces back to a row here.

Legend for `Trust`:
- `manufacturer` — published by the OEM on an official spec page.
- `regulatory` — filed with a government body (e.g. CARB).
- `measured` — observed real-world operating data from a credible study.
- `secondary` — reputable third-party reporting, used only where the primary source is not (yet) accessible. Flagged in-product.
- `synthetic` — invented by us for demonstration. Always badged in the UI and carries `data_source: "synthetic"` in code.

## 3. APIs (live integrations — keys provisioned by operator, never committed)

### NREL Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) — charging stations
- **Source / docs:** https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/transportation/alt-fuel-stations-v1/
- **Key:** https://developer.nrel.gov/ (free)
- **Used for:** real, current US charging-station locations (`fuel_type=ELEC`, DC fast / high-power).

### Open Charge Map — charging stations (cross-check)
- **Source / docs:** https://openchargemap.org/site/develop/api
- **Used for:** corroborating NREL; connector/power-level detail.

### Mapbox Directions — routing
- **Source / docs:** https://docs.mapbox.com/api/navigation/directions/
- **Used for:** real road distance + drive-time. Server-side only (token kept on backend); a separate public `pk` token is used frontend-only for map display.

## 4. Synthetic data (the only invented data in the product)

### Sample load roster (CA / TX lanes)
- **Trust:** synthetic
- **Why synthetic:** no public dataset of an electric carrier's actual freight exists.
- **Handling:** every record carries `data_source: "synthetic"` in the DB and renders a "sample data" badge in the UI. Designed for trivial replacement via real CSV upload.
